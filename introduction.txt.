Brief Introduction About Myself

Hi! there, I am Hlayiso Gift Nkuna. I am a passionate student with a strong interest in Software Development. I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems and leaning new 
technologies along the way. Currently I am working on learning more about tech and I already have skills on collaborating with others, solving conflicts, and solving real-world problems. 
I am always open to collaborating on exciting and meaningful projects. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!
