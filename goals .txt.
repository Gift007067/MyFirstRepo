My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
By this time of the year next year, I would wish to be accepted in the Universities that I applied to and continue my journey of getting a degree. If I am not accepted in any of those universities
I will join programs that teaches me about skills in tech and get a job. Personally by this time of the year, I would have lost about 5kg of my weight and have already started my MMA journey.
